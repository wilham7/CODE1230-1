collected?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">The census in general is a useful tool that aids both government departments and private corporations in their endeavours. When data is collected from individuals, the services that both the government and the private sector provide can be tailored for more efficient outcomes that address the issues that individuals face. This process continually leads society towards a state of higher quality of life, especially when governmental departments are the orchestrators.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>3.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Which government department do you think will use this?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">The government planning departments are likely to use this dataset to determine zoning requirements to suit the residents of the area. For example, if there is a higher proportion of families, zoning will likely require less apartments against houses. Parks, playgrounds and other recreational locations popular with families will be created in areas that are reported to have a higher proportion of married couples. Having said this, other datasets are likely more useful to the government in this matter, such as family sizes and age of children per household. Similar information may only be inferred in this dataset that is clearly represented in others.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>4.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Which private sector will use this?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">There are two industries that will most likely find this data useful: architectural firms and wedding related businesses. Architectural firms will be able to use this data and determine the likelihood of different types of architecture being needed. For example, when there are a larger proportion of de facto relationships, the likelihood of relationships leading to large families is much smaller than in a neighbourhood where a lot of individuals marry at a younger age. For wedding related businesses, the data can be used to find a location that will both have a large proportion of marriages, as well as a population that is more likely to spend more on their wedding. This will most likely be in a more affluent area where individuals marry at a generally later (and thus richer) stage in their life. Other than these two, the dining sector alongside a majority of retail businesses can benefit from this data - in areas with a higher proportion of de facto relationships, dining can most likely afford to be more expensive, the same being true for other businesses, although higher quality is expected.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">It should be noted however, that very few commercial businesses are likely to use this data to shape their business models, as there are many other more significant factors that have a greater influence on business success. Another issue with this dataset is most of the information it provides is already covered in other sets, so the only unique category provided by this is de facto vs conventional marriage. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>5.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c3">How would this dataset change the way you think about space?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">This dataset allows those that view it to see another dimension of especially Sydney but also greater NSW - a dimension of the marital status of individuals correspondent to their location. This data also allows us to infer from it cultural and ethical aspects of different regions that would otherwise be difficult to discern.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">Space is a term that is evolving, especially now that we have entered a digital era, where non-physical realms play a large role in individual&rsquo;s day-to-day lives. Because of this, our perception of space has to reflect this change, this dataset being a relatively inconsequential example of a larger phenomena warping society.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>6.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c3">How does this dataset change across sydney?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">Many different datasets collected in the census correlate to the latte line, however Marital Status generally has a unique trend. The most obvious being a cluster in the Inner-West that spreads outwards. For example, the amount of unmarried and de facto relationships are the highest in the Inner-West, and this is inversely proportional to the rest of Sydney in an outward direction. Another observable trend is the amount of unmarried individuals follows train lines and high density residential zones, as there are many apartments here, obviously suited to smaller families.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 405.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 405.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">Purple = Invalid data</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">Light Orange = Low single rate</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">Dark Red = High single rate</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>7.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c3">How does it relate to the latte line?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">A lot of the data covered either has a small or no link to the latte line. The latte line can be seen quite clearly when plotting the number of married individuals vs total population however this data is not unique to G06. In this plot there is a notably larger percentage of married people on the southwest side of the line. Having said this, the trend is quite weak compared to other datasets that have a strong contrast along the latte line.</span></p><p class="c5"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 486.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 486.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c10 c9"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9">A rough trend that obeys the latte line (Population of unmarried males)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>8.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c3">How has the dataset changed between 2011 and 2016?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">There has been a visible increase in marriage and de facto relationship rates against single rates contrary to preconceptions. This change however is not seen in any particular regions of Sydney but rather has simply been an overall adjustment of Sydney&rsquo;s population towards this direction. For example, in the inner west, a location already having a relatively high rate of de facto relationships, the rate has increased marginally especially relative to the rate of singles.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>9.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c3">How is this dataset significant to people&rsquo;s lives?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">This data is significant because the distribution of married/de facto/unmarried individuals shapes the community and space in which they live. The types of people living in an area heavily affect the urban space of the region and the types of culture that is experienced. The types of families living in certain areas changes the types of residences available, which has a major impact on the area, for example, the traffic and level of crowding. Not only does marital status affect average family size, but it also shapes the culture of an area. This can be seen when comparing two contrasting areas such as Newtown, a suburb with very high unmarried and de facto rates to St Ives, an inverse population. Along with the differing marital statuses between the two, they also have very different cultures and lifestyles. Newtown is famous for being a trendy, cultural hub in centre of Sydney which is vastly different to the more traditional and spacious suburb of St Ives.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>10.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Would it be good for this data to change?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">It&rsquo;s difficult to discern whether or not a change in this data would result in a positive or negative outcome for the city at large due to the plethora of multi-faceted issues that would have to be addressed in a comprehensive study. Despite this, from a largely naive point of reference, it would most likely be beneficial for this data to change. Given that pushing the average quality of life upwards is the goal of any change in this data, a shift of de-facto relationships into various hubs across Sydney would prove positive. Maintaining regions of high de-facto relationships is crucial to creating an area that is suitable for these individuals, similarly to how regions of marrieds with children is crucial to creating an area suitable for them, however the general proportion of de-facto relationships would mean that family dynamics would dominate any area that has an average proportion of all populations. The spread of these hubs is also crucial however, to ensure that individuals of all marital statuses enjoy the benefits of the hubs of different marital statuses without having to travel inconceivably long distances. Without a spread of hubs, Sydney&rsquo;s traffic issues will become further prevalent in society when individual&rsquo;s needs are not standard with their stereotypical needs.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">Currently, the spread of singles is largely correspondent with locations that have low travel distances to the inner city as well as locations that are close to train stations. This is also true of de-facto relationships, however de-facto relationships are less likely to live near train stations but rather opt for inner-city housing that may potentially be minimally further out. Married individuals, who have a much higher chance of having children, occupy all the space that the other two don&rsquo;t - locations that are further away from the city and are further away from better transport systems that lead towards the city. Realistically, in order for Sydney&rsquo;s traffic issues to be resolved, a train system that covers a greater area of Sydney has to be put in place, as the location of transport systems inform the locations that individuals of different marital statuses choose to occupy, rather than the other way around.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>11.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">If you wanted to change it, how would you change it?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>The current distribution of marital status would be quite easy to change through the redistribution of housing sizes. There is an obvious trend of unmarried and de facto individuals living in smaller housing, most commonly found in the city and Inner-West. If appartments and other small residences were moved further away from the city and larger dwellings were moved closer, this would create a more balanced distribution of the different marital statuses. </span></p></body></html>
