For our final multi-layered map, we decided to incorporate a second dataset to be able to gain new understanding about the marital status data. The analysis that can be made from just the original dataset is limited to the narrow scope of information it provides and our understanding of Sydney as an urban space to compare it to. By introducing the G14 Religious Affiliation dataset we hoped to explain some of the cultural trends observed earlier in our investigation that could not be explained through the materiality of the city. The two dimensions of this map show a very clear correlation between a lack of religion and the quantity of de facto relationships. This is particularly prominent around the inner city and even more so in the Inner West. All the western regions of Sydney further support this correlation through an inverse result. While still following this trend, a surprising result was the high levels of both de facto relationships and non religious persons in the Blue Mountains. This map is incredibly useful for showing how our understanding of marital status is restricted if built features are the only variable considered and that cultural influences are unavoidable in a thorough study of the data.
