Through the analysis of maps suggested by the python script we were able to get a good understanding of the major trends within the marital status data. There are several obvious patterns throughout Sydney that dictate where all married, de facto and single individuals are most likely to reside. Despite the insightful conclusions we have already drawn from the maps above, the data is fairly one dimensional and therefore limited in its usefulness. By plotting two data sets against each other, we are be able to draw much more interesting conclusions and gain a deeper understanding about the demographics of Sydney. We decided the best way to approach this was with 3 different methods. Firstly, we would plot two datasets from the 2016 G06 Marital Status against each other. Secondly we would plot a dataset from the 2016 G06 Marital Status against a dataset from the 2011 G06 Marital Status. Finally we would plot a dataset from the 2016 G06 Marital Status against a different community profile, specifically 2016 G14.
