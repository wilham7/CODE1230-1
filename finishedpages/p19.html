Despite the fact that the marital status dataset first appears to have too much data with little value, multiple layers of analysis shows that there are clear and definitive trends observable. The choice of one's location of residence both shapes and is shaped by their marital status. Married couples are most likely to live in suburban areas where housing is appropriate for large families, singles around the city and on train lines where apartments and small housing can be found and de facto couples in the Inner West where it is more culturally normal. 
<br><br>
With data like this it is always important to consider if it should be changed and how that is achieved. However, we believe that the trends in the data are not inherently bad and are simply a product of the urban landscape of Sydney and the cultural values held by different regions of the city. Certain areas that are more suited to housing families due to the sizing of the residences correctly have a larger portion of married couples than those that are not. Similarly, the proportions of types of marriage (regular vs de facto) are varied simply because of the cultural values held by the residents of certain regions and this does not affect the type of housing suitable for them or their requirements of their urban surroundings.

<br><br>

Despite this, from a largely naive point of reference (as this would require further investigation into entirely different sets of data), it would most likely be beneficial for this data to change. Given that pushing the average quality of life upwards is the goal of any change in this data, a shift of de-facto relationships into various hubs across Sydney would prove positive. Maintaining regions of high de-facto relationships is crucial to creating an area that is suitable for these individuals, similarly to how regions of marrieds with children is crucial to creating an area suitable for them, however the general proportion of de-facto relationships would mean that family dynamics would dominate any area that has an average proportion of all populations. The spread of these hubs is also crucial however, to ensure that individuals of all marital statuses enjoy the benefits of the hubs of different marital statuses without having to travel inconceivably long distances. Without a spread of hubs, Sydney’s traffic issues will become further prevalent in society when individual’s needs are not standard with their stereotypical needs.

<br><br>

This will require further research to be analysed effectively. For now, it is clear that the marital status of individuals largely influences their location of residence, especially when considered alongside other relevant demographical information.
