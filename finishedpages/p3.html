On a first observation of the dataset we found it very hard to find any meaningful or significant data as many of the columns had very little or insignificant data. Accompanied by the large amount of different categories in the dataset, finding good data to work with would be a laborious and slow task. As a substitute to this, we decided to write a python script that would help us pick out the best data to work with. This ‘Trend Finder’ worked as such:

<br>
1. Find centre points of each area<bl>_____________________________________</bl>
<br>
2. Correlate each data point to its corresponding centre<bl>______________________</bl>
<br>
3. For each column, find an appropriate cut-off point to split the set in two<bl>_________</bl>
<br>
4. Find the spatial centre of each half of the dataset<bl>________________________</bl>
<br>
5. Determine the distance between the average centres of the two halves of the dataset
<br>
6. Find the datasets with the largest distance between the averages<bl>_____________</bl>
<br>

Our intuition regarding the result was that as the distance between the two averages grows, a larger spatial difference is observed, leading to more meaningful conclusions from the dataset.
