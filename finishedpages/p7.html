The graph generated in the Jupyter notebook previous to this is a visualisation of the results from the Trend Finder script. The bar graph allowed us to quickly visualise and understand what data would have the biggest and smallest variations in them and thus what would make interesting maps. After looking at some of the datasets to verify that the algorithm had worked correctly, we were able to select out which categories we wanted to map. We concluded that 5 rightmost results in the chart could be classed as outliers and not used to portray good data. This makes sense as both of them engage with the extremities of the population; 85+ y/o’s in defacto relationships and 15-19 y/o’s who are married.
