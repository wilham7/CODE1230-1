85+ population in de facto relationships as a percentage of 85+ population

</b><br><br>

This is an example of one of the extreme outliers that our script produced. The tiny amount of individuals who make up this demographic are scattered randomly but the midpoint of the area has generated in such a way that it was highly differed from that of where they are not. There arenâ€™t many meaningful conclusions that we can draw from this map, except for the fact that the de facto elderly population is very small and also dispersed.
