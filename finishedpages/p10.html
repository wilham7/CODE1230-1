45-54 females in de facto relationships as a percentage of 45-54 females

</b><br><br>

This map is taken as an example of a mid range dataset from our chart. As expected, it shows a fair amount of separation between the high and low values. There is quite an obvious concentration of de facto relationships in the Inner West as well as along the northern beaches. The reasoning for this trend is not as easy to predict as the previous map, as there are no built features that would explain the results. Instead, this trend is most likely due to cultural values of different regions and the significance placed on marriage, an idea we intend to explore in a future map.
