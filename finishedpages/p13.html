The first multi-layered map compares both the ratio of single boys to single girls as well as the total amount of singles in a given area. This data produced some very interesting results. The most obvious of these being that the large majority of Sydney has a higher percentage of single girls than single boys. This applies for almost all of Sydney and extends to the Blue Mountains, however, as soon as you extend to greater NSW, the inverse can be seen. This was an extremely unexpected result given that the NSW population is almost exactly split equally between the genders. The other most noticeable trend is the height peaks that occur around the inner city. If you are looking for singles, you will have a much better chance of this around the city as opposed to the North Shore. This trend is another one that can easily be attributed to the kinds of residences available for singles and families being in urban and suburban areas respectively.
