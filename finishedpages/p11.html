20-24 females in marriages as a percentage of 20-24 females

</b><br><br>

Ignoring the outliers at the end of the chart, this is the map that was suggested as the most varied and therefore ‘interesting’ by our script. This map shows a huge divide in the data with a high concentration of young marriages being located in the West, with close to zero in the northern and eastern areas of Sydney. This data is a prime example of the Latte Line and is likely true for two main reasons. Firstly, the cultural values of the highlighted areas are potentially more supportive of earlier marriage and family oriented lifestyle. Secondly, housing in the Western Sydney is significantly cheaper and therefore much more realistic for a young family to be able to afford.
