The second interactive map has allowed us to explore the change in demographic of NSW over a 5 year period. This map allows the viewer to see the movement patterns of families; which regions are growing in their married population and which are declining. Most of Sydney is green which is to be expected simply due to population increase, however dark green areas highlight regions that experienced a large growth in the number of families between 2011 and 2016. This is particularly prominent in the north and northwestern suburbs of Sydney, which suggests these are the kinds of areas married families are moving to bring up families. These suburbs that are further away from the CBD are well suited to families and children as there is more open space and housing can be larger. In contrary to Sydney, almost all of the rest of NSW is red, suggesting that the rural population is being forced towards cities, also including Newcastle and Coffs Harbour and that the demographic of the state is becoming polarised.
