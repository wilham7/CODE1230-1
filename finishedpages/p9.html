35-44 females that are single as a percentage of 35-44 females

</b><br><br>

This map explores an example of a demographic that is equally spread throughout Sydney, as suggested by our chart. Despite being almost uniformly spread, there are still some observable patterns and trends. Firstly, regions outside of urban and suburban areas all have very low rates of single 35-44 y/o females. Secondly, there is a slightly denser concentration of this demographic both around the CBD as well as the T1 Northern train line. These patterns can be attributed to the type of housing found here, with apartments being more suited to singles as opposed to families.
